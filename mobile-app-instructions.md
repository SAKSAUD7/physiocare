# Creating a PhysioCare Android App (APK)

## Overview
This guide explains how to convert the PhysioCare Next.js web application into an Android APK using Capacitor.

## Prerequisites
- Android Studio installed
- JDK 11+ installed
- Node.js and npm installed
- A working build of the PhysioCare web app

## Steps to Generate an APK

### 1. Install Capacitor
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android
npx cap init PhysioCare io.physiocare.app --web-dir=out
```

### 2. Build your Next.js app for production
```bash
npm run build
next export
```

> Note: You may need to add `"export": "next export"` to your package.json scripts and modify next.config.js to support static exports.

### 3. Add Android platform
```bash
npx cap add android
```

### 4. Update the capacitor.config.ts file
Create or update it with:
```typescript
import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'io.physiocare.app',
  appName: 'PhysioCare',
  webDir: 'out',
  server: {
    androidScheme: 'https'
  }
};

export default config;
```

### 5. Copy web assets to Android
```bash
npx cap sync
```

### 6. Open in Android Studio
```bash
npx cap open android
```

### 7. Build the APK in Android Studio
- In Android Studio, go to Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
- Or use the command line: `./gradlew assembleDebug`

The APK will be generated in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Notes
- You'll need to customize the Android app's icon, splash screen, and permissions in Android Studio
- For a production release, you'll need to create a signed APK
- Consider integrating any native features you might need (camera, notifications, etc.)

## Alternative Solutions
If you need a more native experience, consider rebuilding the app with:
1. React Native
2. Flutter 
3. Native Android development in Kotlin or Java

These would require more development time but offer better performance and native feel.
